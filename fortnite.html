This page we will be taking mostly about what fortnite is. Fortnite is an muiltyplayer game it came out in 2017 and it is teens game,but children still play it (with restrictions) <br>
its also a free game, you can play on any platform, (playstion,pc,xbox,nintedeo,mobile,xbox). This game was really popular when it came out, there were streamers<br>
like ninja that would stream there gameplay and would be getting thousands and 10 thousands of viewers.
There would be lots of people wanting to play the game and lots of people were<br>really good at this
game, so people wanted to be really competive, but competive era of fortnite <br>
doesnt come til 2019. As the years go by. the game does good and there are times when it fell off. But in 2023, fortnite did something that changed everything. they brought back the starting of the game.<br>
That means that they put the old map from 2017 and everything from 2017 that they did back into the game. Because that 2017 era of fortnite was called prime fortnite.<br>
The day of the bringing back og, fortnite had 10 million active players, and 100 million that day. Just from that you can see that how successful<br>


Some things about prime fortnite. The new and great thing about prime fortnite was that it had bosses which players never saw in the game so it was a suprise for all, some main bosses would be<br>
Brutus<br>
Midas<br>
Skye<br>
these bosses had diffrent weapons that they would drop when taken down and they were really good.<br>
fortnite really is. I hope you understand what fortnite is and maybe you should give it a try.<br>
