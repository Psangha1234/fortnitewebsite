      This is the home page for the best game in my opion<br>
      I chose fortnite because i am good at it, and i guess its just in me.<br>
      I feel like i am really good at the game, i am good at other games like call of duty<br>
      and im also good at fifa and rocket league. But i just have to put fortnite in first because its a great.<br>
